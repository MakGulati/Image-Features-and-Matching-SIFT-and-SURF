# Image Features and Matching

Project 1 - Analysis and Search of Visual Data (EQ2425) - Federico Favia & Mayank Gulati, September 2019, KTH, Stockholm

This project in Matlab developed within the course of Analysis and Search of Visual Data (EQ2425) at KTH investigates the results of two popular
scale-invariant feature detectors, SIFT and SURF, to find features in images. In this project, the open source Matlab library VLFeat for SIFT features is used. 
Both quantitative and qualitative analysis are conducted. See the report for more information.
